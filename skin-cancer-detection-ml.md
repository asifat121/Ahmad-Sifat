# Skin Cancer Detection & Classification (Deep Learning)

## Overview
A deep learning project focused on **medical image classification**, applying CNN architectures and transfer learning to improve diagnostic accuracy for skin lesion detection.

## Problem Statement
Manual diagnosis of skin cancer can be time-consuming and subjective. This project explores how machine learning can assist clinicians by providing accurate and scalable image classification.

## Responsibilities
- Designed baseline CNN architecture
- Implemented transfer learning using ResNet50
- Tuned hyperparameters and evaluated model performance
- Compared baseline and optimized models

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- CNN, Transfer Learning

## Results
- **92% validation accuracy**
- **15% improvement** over baseline CNN models

## Key Takeaway
Highlights ability to **build, evaluate, and improve ML models independently**, a critical skill for remote ML and AI roles.
